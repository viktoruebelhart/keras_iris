# Keras: Neural Networks
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the academic community, this dataset consists of 50 samples of each of the three species (150 samples in total) of Iris: Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.

Four variables were measured in each sample: the length and width of the sepals (Sepal) and petals (Petal), in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four characteristics, it is possible to distinguish species from each other.
